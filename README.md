# Turb_Matlab
This is a collection of scripts and functions that I used during my PhD for the analysis of magnetic field fluctuationsin the framework of plasma turbulence. 
They are tailored to the analyses of magnetospheric turbulence at Saturn, but should be of use also for other environments such as, e.g., the solar wind.

You are welcome to use any or all of this code. If you need help, just drop me a line.

Language: Matlab
